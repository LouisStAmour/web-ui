wiki_css sample application written with the Dart Web UI package, which includes
web component using scoped styles with and without apply-author-styles.

To run this code, launch "web/index.html". If you encounter an error about a
missing "web/out/index.html" file, right click on "build.dart" and select "Run".

Generated code will be created under "web/out/". Any time you edit and save a
source file, the necessary files will be regenerated automatically. Look at
"build.dart" to see how this works.

This example is interactivly changed in the web_ui WIKI pages:
